# Terraform Consul ACL Provider

## Overview

This provider defines a Terraform resource that allows one to manage Consul ACL tokens with Terraform.

## Resources

This plugin defines following resources: 
* `transform_group_by_value` - manages a single Consul ACL token

## Reference

Provider is configurable with number of parameters:

* `address` - String, host and port used to connect to Consul. Defaults to `localhost:8500`. Can be set via environment
variables `CONSUL_ADDRESS` or `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`.
* `datacenter` - String, datacenter to operate in. Defaults to empty values which means local datacenter. Can be set via
environment variable `CONSUL_DATACENTER`.
* `token` - String, ACL token to use for API calls to Consul. Must be a `management` token to manage ACLs. Defaults to
empty value. Can be set via environment variables `CONSUL_TOKEN` or `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN`.
* `scheme` - String, scheme to use to connect to Consul. Defaults to `http`. Can be set via environment variables
`CONSUL_SCHEME` or `CONSUL_HTTP_SCHEME`.
* `ca_file` - String, path to a certificate of a certification authority (CA) that was used to sign Consul's TLS
certificate and therefore should be used for TLS validation. Defaults to system bundle if not specified. Can be set via
environment variable `CONSUL_CA_FILE`.
* `cert_file` - String, path to a client certificate for client-side TLS authentication, if enabled in Consul. Can be
set via environment variable `CONSUL_CERT_FILE`.
* `key_file` - String, path to a private key for client certificate provided in `cert_file`. Can be set via environment
variable `CONSUL_KEY_FILE`.
* `tls_skip_verify` - Bool, whether to skip verification of Consul's TLS certificate. Defaults to `false`. Can be set via
environment variable `CONSUL_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY`.

### consulacl_token

#### Arguments

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) String defining name for the token
* `type` - (Required) String defining type of the token - either `client` or `management`
* `token` - (Optional) If set, defines the token ID. If unset - a unique UUID will be generated by Consul and exported
by the resource. It is a sensitive data.
* `rule` - (Optional) Set of rules to assign to the token. Each rule is defined as a map with following fields:
  * `scope` - (Required) String defining a scope of the rule. One of: `agent`, `event`, `key`, `node`, `query`,
  `service`, `session`, `keyring` and `operator`.
  * `policy` - (Required) String defining a policy of the rule. One of: `read`, `write`.
  * `prefix` - (Optional) String defining a prefix limiting the rule's effect. Not allowed for `keyring` and
  `operator` scopes.  

#### Attributes

The following attribute is exported:

* `token` - String, the ACL token's value. Sensitive.
* `id` - String, SHA256 hash of `token` attribute.

## Installation

> Terraform automatically discovers the Providers when it parses configuration files.
> This only occurs when the init command is executed.

Currently Terraform is able to automatically download only
[official plugins distributed by HashiCorp](https://github.com/terraform-providers).

[All other plugins](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/type/community-index.html) should be installed manually.

> Terraform will search for matching Providers via a
> [Discovery](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/how-terraform-works.html#discovery) process, **including the current
> local directory**.

This means that the plugin should either be placed into current working directory where Terraform will be executed from
or it can be [installed system-wide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins).

## Usage

### main.tf
```hcl
resource "consulacl_token" "token" {
  name  = "A demo token"
  token = "my-custom-token"
  type  = "client"

  rule { scope="key"      policy="write"  prefix="foo/bar/baz"  }
  rule { scope="service"  policy="read"   prefix=""             }
  rule { scope="operator" policy="read"                         }
}
```

### Download
```bash
$ wget "https://github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl/releases/download/v1.0.0/terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.0.0-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-amd64"
$ chmod +x ./terraform-provider-transform*
```

### Init
```bash
$ ls -1
  main.tf
  terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.0.0-linux-amd64

$ terraform init
  
  Initializing provider plugins...
  
  The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
  so the latest version was installed.
  
  To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
  changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
  corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
  suggested below.
  
  * provider.consulacl: version = "~> 1.0"
  
  Terraform has been successfully initialized!
  
  You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
  any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
  should now work.
  
  If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
  rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
  commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

### Apply

```bash
$ terraform apply
  
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    + consulacl_token.token
        id:                     <computed>
        name:                   "A demo token"
        rule.#:                 "3"
        rule.1495889372.policy: "write"
        rule.1495889372.prefix: "foo/bar/baz"
        rule.1495889372.scope:  "key"
        rule.2015766991.policy: "read"
        rule.2015766991.prefix: ""
        rule.2015766991.scope:  "service"
        rule.4269786272.policy: "read"
        rule.4269786272.prefix: ""
        rule.4269786272.scope:  "operator"
        token:                  <sensitive>
        type:                   "client"
  
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  Do you want to perform these actions?
    Terraform will perform the actions described above.
    Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

## Development

### Go

In order to work on the provider, [Go](http://www.golang.org) should be installed first (version 1.8+ is *required*).
[goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv) and [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) are great utilities that can help a
lot with that and simplify setup tremendously. 
[GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) should be setup correctly and as long as `$GOPATH/bin` should be
added `$PATH`.

### Source Code

Source code can be retrieved either with `go get`

```bash
$ go get -u -d github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl
```

or with `git`
```bash
$ mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl
$ git clone git@github.com:ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl.git .
```

### Test

```bash
$ make test
  go test -v ./...
  ?   	github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl	[no test files]
  === RUN   TestProvider
  --- PASS: TestProvider (0.00s)
  PASS
  ok  	github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl/consulacl	0.028s
  go vet ./...
```

### Build
In order to build plugin for the current platform use [GNU]make:
```bash
$ make build
  go build -o terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.0.0

```

it will build provider from sources and put it into current working directory.

If Terraform was installed (as a binary) or via `go get -u github.com/hashicorp/terraform` it'll pick up the plugin if 
executed against a configuration in the same directory.

### Release

In order to prepare provider binaries for all platforms:
```bash
$ make release
  GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o './release/terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.1.0-darwin-amd64'
  GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o './release/terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.1.0-linux-amd64'
```
