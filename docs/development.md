# Development

## Go

In order to work on the provider, [Go](http://www.golang.org) should be installed first (version 1.13+ is *required*).
[goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv) and [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) are great utilities that can help a
lot with that and simplify setup tremendously. 
[GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) should be setup correctly and `$GOPATH/bin` should be
added `$PATH`.

This plugin uses Go modules available starting from Go `1.11` and therefore it **should not** be checked out within `$GOPATH` tree.

## Source Code

Source code can be retrieved with `git`
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl.git .
```

## Dependencies

This project uses `go mod` to manage its dependencies and it's expected that all dependencies are vendored so that
it's buildable without internet access. When adding/removing a dependency run following commands:
```bash
$ go mod vendor
$ go mod tidy
```

## Test

### Unit Tests

```bash
$ make test
  GOPROXY="off" GOFLAGS="-mod=vendor" go test -v ./...
  ?   	github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl	[no test files]
  === RUN   TestIntegrationDataSourceToken
  --- SKIP: TestIntegrationDataSourceToken (0.00s)
      testing.go:461: Acceptance tests skipped unless env 'TF_ACC' set
  === RUN   TestProvider
  --- PASS: TestProvider (0.00s)
  === RUN   TestIntegrationToken
  --- SKIP: TestIntegrationToken (0.00s)
      testing.go:461: Acceptance tests skipped unless env 'TF_ACC' set
  === RUN   TestIntegrationTokenImport
  --- SKIP: TestIntegrationTokenImport (0.00s)
      testing.go:461: Acceptance tests skipped unless env 'TF_ACC' set
  PASS
  ok  	github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl/consulacl	(cached)
  GOPROXY="off" GOFLAGS="-mod=vendor" go vet ./...
```

### Integration Tests

This requires a running Consul agent locally.

```bash
$ make test-integration
  TF_ACC=1 CONSUL_TOKEN=secret go test -v ./... -timeout 1m
  ?   	github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl	[no test files]
  === RUN   TestIntegrationDataSourceToken
  --- PASS: TestIntegrationDataSourceToken (0.04s)
  === RUN   TestProvider
  --- PASS: TestProvider (0.00s)
  === RUN   TestIntegrationToken
  --- PASS: TestIntegrationToken (0.21s)
  === RUN   TestIntegrationTokenImport
  --- PASS: TestIntegrationTokenImport (0.04s)
  PASS
  ok  	github.com/ashald/terraform-provider-consulacl/consulacl	(cached)
```

If you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed, you can run Consul with the following command:
```bash
$ make test-server
  latest: Pulling from library/consul
  Digest: sha256:ae2c9409a77533485982c00f5c1eab89c090889318cb2f4276d64a7d125f83f8
  Status: Image is up to date for consul:latest
  docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8500:8500 -e CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG='{"acl_datacenter": "dc1", "acl_master_token": "secret", "bootstrap_expect": 1, "server": true, "ui": true}' 'consul:latest'
  ...
```

By default, this will use the
[latest version of Consul based on the latest image in the Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/consul/).
You can specify a version using `CONSUL_VERSION` environment variable:
```bash
$ CONSUL_VERSION=1.2.0 make test-server
```

This command will run in foreground and will stop Consul when interrupted.
Images will be cached locally by Docker so it is quick to restart the server as necessary.
This will expose Consul on the default address `127.0.0.1:8500` but this can be changed with `CONSUL_ADDRESS`
environment variable.

## Build
In order to build plugin for the current platform use [GNU]make:
```bash
$ make build
  go build -o terraform-provider-consulacl_1.3.0

```

it will build provider from sources and put it into current working directory.

If Terraform was installed (as a binary) or via `go get -u github.com/hashicorp/terraform` it'll pick up the plugin if 
executed against a configuration in the same directory.

## Release

In order to prepare provider binaries for all platforms:
```bash
$ make release
  GOPROXY="off" GOFLAGS="-mod=vendor" GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o './release/terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.4.0-darwin-amd64'
  GOPROXY="off" GOFLAGS="-mod=vendor" GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o './release/terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.4.0-linux-amd64'
  GOPROXY="off" GOFLAGS="-mod=vendor" GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o './release/terraform-provider-consulacl_v1.4.0-windows-amd64'
```
